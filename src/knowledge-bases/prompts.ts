# Einstein's Theory of Relativity

Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905) and general theory of relativity (1915) revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.

# History of Quantum Mechanics

Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect proposed that light consists of discrete quantum particles (photons), not just waves. This work earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 and was crucial to the development of quantum theory.

Despite his contributions, Einstein became a critic of quantum mechanics' probabilistic nature, famously stating "God does not play dice with the universe." His debates with Niels Bohr at the Solvay Conferences (1927-1930) are legendary in physics history.

In 1935, Einstein co-authored the EPR paradox paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, challenging quantum mechanics' completeness and introducing the concept of quantum entanglement, which he called "spooky action at a distance."

<answer>
Einstein made several significant contributions to quantum mechanics, despite later becoming one of its critics. His most notable contribution was <cite fileName="quantum-history.md">his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, which proposed that light consists of discrete quantum particles (photons), not just waves</cite>. This groundbreaking work <cite fileName="quantum-history.md">earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 and was crucial to the development of quantum theory</cite>.

Interestingly, <cite fileName="quantum-history.md">despite his contributions, Einstein became a critic of quantum mechanics' probabilistic nature, famously stating "God does not play dice with the universe."</cite> His skepticism led to important theoretical developments and debates that helped clarify quantum concepts.

One of his most important later contributions was <cite fileName="quantum-history.md">in 1935, when Einstein co-authored the EPR paradox paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, challenging quantum mechanics' completeness and introducing the concept of quantum entanglement, which he called "spooky action at a distance."</cite> This work, though intended as a criticism, actually helped identify quantum entanglement, which is now a cornerstone of modern quantum information science.

The retrieved notes don't mention Einstein's contributions to the theory of Bose-Einstein condensates or his work on stimulated emission that later led to the development of lasers, which were also significant contributions related to quantum theory.
